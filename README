# GeoHex class
* GeoHex class can convert between latitude/longitude and GeoHex
  V1: ported from ruby implementation by @hal_sk.
  V2: ported from JavaScript implementation by @sa2da.

  Currently only #decode, #encode, #getZoneByLocation and #getZoneByCode methods are ready.
  Other methods will be provided after well tested.

# INSTALL
* Simply copy net.geohex.GeoHex.java into your app.

# USAGE

  import net.geohex.GeoHex;

  String code = GeoHex.encode(35.780516755235475, 139.57031250000003, 9);
  // code -> "jjdK3"
  GeoHex.Zone z = GeoHex.decode("jjdK3"); // decode method is an alias of getZoneByCode.
  // z.lat -> 35.780516755235475
  // z.lon -> 139.57031250000003
  // z.level -> 9
  // z.getHexSize() -> 13045.252825520833
  GeoHex.Loc[] polygon = z.polygon;
  // [0]:{35.780516755235475,139.33593750000003}
  // [1]:{35.945011915675025,139.45312500000006}
  // [2]:{35.945011915675025,139.68750000000006}
  // [3]:{35.780516755235475,139.80468750000006}
  // [4]:{35.61568052680066,139.68750000000006}
  // [5]:{35.61568052680066,139.45312500000006}

  or

  GeoHex.Zone zone1 = GeoHex.getZoneByLocation(35.780516755235475, 139.57031250000003, 9);
  // zone1.code -> "jjdK3"
  GeoHex.Zone zone2 = GeoHex.getZoneByCode("jjdK3");
  // zone2.lat -> 35.780516755235475
  // zone2.lon -> 139.57031250000003
  // zone2.level -> 9
  // ...
  GeoHex.Zone zone3 = GeoHex.getZoneByXY(293.0, -104.0, 9);
  // zone3.lat -> 35.780516755235475
  // zone3.lon -> 139.57031250000003
  // zone3.level -> 9
  ...
